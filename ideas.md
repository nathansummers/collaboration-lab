I think a text based CYOA would be a cool idea to start with. We could implement a combat system, inventory & equipment, and a travelling system.

We'd at minimum want a Character Superclass, containing Player and Enemy.
Those would have stats like HP, def, atk, and maybe magic ability. Character would have inventory and potions, monster would have some extra stats, maybe scaling or special perks.


From there we'd probably want to implement a locations superclass, so we can outline what locations are what, and
perhaps some special traits they have. Locations could have negative effects on certain gear due to climate, weather, or otherwise.

Other classes we may need:
    Inventory management class that stores what items the player can use
    Item class that can be stored in the inventory
    Combat manager class that handles turns and attack order
    Skill tree class if we decide to include leveling up and improving skills

I think that for the progression, we could split the CYOA into 3 zones, each one being its own location that you trudge through. I'm pulling this idea from "An Average Campaign" on roblox, which utilizes a very similar system to
progress the players by splitting their own CYOA into zones.
Perhaps zone 1 would be like a forest, then the player could go to a river or mountain, and finally the volcano to fight the final boss which could be a dragon or evil villain or something.
